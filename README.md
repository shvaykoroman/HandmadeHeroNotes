all this code taken from (https://handmade.network/) created by **Casey Muratori.**
I will following episodes coding along and writting some notes here.

** DAY 44 - Reflecting vectors **
- A bit math about vectors
- "Inner" operation

*** DAY 45 - Geometric vs Temporal Movement Search ***
- Start implementing new collision detection system "Search in P"

*** DAY 46 - Multiplayer support ***
- Pulled out movement code for player into function MovePlayer
- Now game can support multiply players with own controllers
- Fixed bug with execution movement code many times.
- Rotate function for LoadBMP function

*** DAY 47 - Vectors length ***
- Math how to get desired vector length.
- Start implementing "Search in T" collision detection cuz "Search in P" too expensive and hard for this game.
- Implementing Min and Max macros.
